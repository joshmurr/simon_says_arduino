## Simon Says â€” [week1 CCI]

A simple game of Simon Says using 4 LEDs, 4 buttons and an Arduino Uno.

It was a challenge getting the functionality of the game up and running, but I think it seems to be working fine! There is definitely scope to add a level system without too much extra work which I do think I will implement, but I decided to spend the extra time this week in the libraries, reading, and C++-ing.

A video of the game in action can be seen below which plays through to winning (click the image).
